        <h3>Errors</h3>
        <p>IMPORTANT: We try very hard to ensure that all information on this site is accurate. However, just occasionally, an error can occur.</p>

        <p>If we discover an error that affects you, we will notify you as soon as possible. In those circumstances we reserve the right to cancel or suspend a transaction until the error is corrected and will use all reasonable efforts to ensure the same error does not reoccur and that it is rectified as quickly as possible.</p>

        <p>We may cancel any Order (as defined below) or sale and not supply the applicable Product if it is reasonable to do so (including without limitation in the event of mistake). We may also change or discontinue the availability of any Products at any time in our sole discretion.</p>


        <h3>Buying Stuff</h3>
        <h4>Purchase, Refund, Returns and Cancellation Policy</h4>
        <p>You may purchase Products through our site as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>When you place an order for a Product (“Order”) this will be deemed an offer to buy the Product for the price stated, subject to these terms and conditions.</li>
          <li>After you have submitted your Order we will send you an e-mail to confirm that we have received it. This email confirmation will be produced automatically so that you have confirmation of your Order details. The fact that you receive an automatic confirmation does not necessarily mean that we will be able to meet your Order.</li>
          <li>Once we have sent the confirmation email we then get to work on meeting your Order and if we can, we will arrange for each Product to be sent to the address stated in the Order process.</li>
          <li>You may at any time within 30 working days of delivery of the Product to you change your mind and cancel your Order and receive a full refund PROVIDED THAT you return the Product to us in its original condition and with its original packaging.</li>
          <li>In the event that a Product is faulty or defective, please contact us as set out below or at <a href="mailto:support@mymakie.com">support@mymakie.com</a> and we will provide you with a replacement or a refund.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Shipping and Delivery</h3>
        <p>We use a third party company to deliver our packages. When you order a customised Makie, we will do our best to create and prepare your Makie for shipping within 15 working days of receiving your order.</p>


        <h3>Price and Payment</h3>
        <p>Payment is due from the moment an Order is accepted.</p>

        <p>Payment may be made as set out on the payment page of our site, by credit card, debit card or any other such method as we may introduce in our sole discretion.</p>

        <p>We aim to debit money from your account within three working days after receiving your Order.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to accept or refuse any payment made in any form.</p>

        <p>Prices are quoted in UK pounds, Euros or US Dollars depending on your geographical location. You must pay in the currency in which the price is quoted. If you do not hold an account in the relevant currency you should pay by debit or credit card (or any other method that we may introduce from time to time) and your card company should exchange the amount charged to the currency of your country at the current rate.</p>

        <p>You will not be charged for any Orders that cannot be fulfilled and where appropriate we will re-credit to your account any sum debited by us.</p>

        <p>We cannot guarantee that a particular Product will always be available.</p>

        <p>Credit/debit card details will be encrypted to minimise the possibility of someone being able to read them as they are sent over the Internet. Please refer to our privacy policy regarding use of your data (including credit card data).</p>

        <p>Your credit card company may also do security checks to confirm it is you making the Order.</p>

        <p>Where applicable, all Order details and invoices will be sent to the credit card billing address and not the delivery address where they differ.</p>

        <p>Your statutory rights are unaffected by these terms and conditions.</p>


        <h3>Promotions and Voucher Codes</h3>
        <p>Where you have a valid promotion code, the following additional terms and conditions apply on the discounts:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>When more than one promotion is running at the same time – the highest value offer only will be valid. Promotions cannot be used with any other promotion.</li>
          <li>Discounts will only be available on Order values over the amount stated in the applicable promotion.</li>
